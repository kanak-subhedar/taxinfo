        <h1>Taxes on FD and RD Interest</h1>
        <h2><a href="https://t24k.com"> Return Home </a></h2>
        <h2>Interest Earned on Fixed Deposits (FD) and Recurring Deposits (RD)</h2>
        <p>Interest earned from <a href="https://t24k.com/FD_RD">Fixed Deposits (FD) and Recurring Deposits (RD)</a> at banks and post offices is considered as "Income from Other Sources" and is fully taxable. The tax treatment of interest income from FDs and RDs is subject to the individual's applicable tax slab rates.</p>

        <h2>Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) on FD and RD Interest</h2>
        <p>Banks and post offices are required to deduct Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on interest income from <a href="https://t24k.com/FD_RD">FDs and RDs</a> if the total interest exceeds ₹40,000 in a financial year. For senior citizens, the TDS threshold is ₹50,000.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TDS is deducted at the rate of 10% if the interest income exceeds the specified threshold.</li>
            <li>If the PAN is not provided to the bank or post office, TDS is deducted at the rate of 20%.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Filing Form 15G/15H to Avoid TDS</h2>
        <p>Individuals whose total income is below the taxable limit can submit Form 15G (for non-senior citizens) or Form 15H (for senior citizens) to the bank or post office to avoid TDS on interest income.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form 15G:</strong> Applicable for individuals below 60 years of age whose total income is below the taxable limit.</li>
            <li><strong>Form 15H:</strong> Applicable for individuals aged 60 years or above whose total income is below the taxable limit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reporting Interest Income in ITR</h2>
        <p>Interest income from <a href="https://t24k.com/FD_RD">FDs and RDs</a> must be reported in the Income Tax Return (ITR) under the head "Income from Other Sources". The total interest earned during the financial year should be included, irrespective of whether TDS has been deducted or not.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The interest income should be reported in the ITR of the financial year in which it is accrued, even if it is not received in the bank account.</li>
            <li>Taxpayers can claim credit for the TDS deducted against their total tax liability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Calculation</h2>
        <p>Consider an individual who earns ₹60,000 as interest from fixed deposits in a financial year. The tax calculation would be as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interest Earned: ₹60,000</li>
            <li>Less: TDS Deducted (10%): ₹6,000</li>
            <li>Net Interest Received: ₹54,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The total interest of ₹60,000 should be included in the individual's total income and taxed according to their income slab rate. The individual can claim credit for the ₹6,000 TDS deducted.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Senior citizens can avail of higher tax benefits on interest income under Section 80TTB, which provides a deduction of up to ₹50,000 on interest income earned from savings accounts, fixed deposits, and recurring deposits.</p>
