    <h1>Income Tax on ₹10 Lakh Salary in India (AY 2025-26) — Full Calculation</h1>

    <p><strong>Quick summary:</strong> For an annual gross salary of ₹10,00,000 in FY 2024–25 (AY 2025–26), this guide shows step-by-step calculations under both regimes, standard deduction, HRA treatment, and common deductions (80C & 80D).</p>

    <h2>Assumptions used in this example</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gross salary: ₹10,00,000 per year (basic + allowances included).</li>
      <li>Standard deduction: as per applicable rule (presently ₹50,000) — we’ll apply the current available amount for AY 2025–26 where relevant.</li>
      <li>Investments under Section 80C: assumed ₹1,50,000 (max allowable).</li>
      <li>Mediclaim (80D): assumed premium ₹10,000.</li>
      <li>No other income (capital gains, rental income etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 1 — Compute taxable salary (example)</h2>
    <p>Gross salary: <strong>₹10,00,000</strong></p>
    <p>Standard deduction: <strong>₹50,000</strong> (example figure — confirm current rule)</p>
    <p>Taxable before deductions: ₹10,00,000 − ₹50,000 = <strong>₹9,50,000</strong></p>

    <h2>Step 2 — Claim 80C & 80D</h2>
    <p>80C investments (PPF / ELSS / EPF / LIC etc.) — claim ₹1,50,000 (max). 80D premium ₹10,000.</p>
    <p>Taxable income after 80C & 80D: 9,50,000 − 1,50,000 − 10,000 = <strong>₹7,90,000</strong></p>

    <h2>Step 3 — Apply slab rates (New regime vs Old regime)</h2>
    <p><strong>Old regime example (illustrative slabs):</strong> Apply slab rates and cess. (Show full slab breakdown on site — use official updated slabs.)</p>

    <h3>Example calculation (old regime-like):</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Up to ₹2.5L — Nil</li>
      <li>₹2.5L–₹5L — 5% on 2.5L = ₹12,500</li>
      <li>₹5L–₹7.5L — 20% on 2.5L = ₹50,000</li>
      <li>₹7.5L–₹7.90L — 30% on ₹40,000 = ₹12,000</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tax (before cess) = ₹12,500 + ₹50,000 + ₹12,000 = ₹74,500</p>
    <p>Add health & education cess (4%) = ₹2,980 → Total tax ≈ <strong>₹77,480</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Notes & optimizations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you reduce taxable income via additional eligible deductions (NPS Tier-1, 80CCD(1B), 80E, house loan interest where applicable), tax can fall further.</li>
      <li>Compare old vs new regime by calculating both — sometimes new regime (lower slab taxes with fewer deductions) is better, sometimes old regime with 80C benefits wins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Actionable checklist</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Collect investment proofs (80C, 80D) before filing ITR.</li>
      <li>Use an Excel template or online calculator to test multiple scenarios (HRA, home loan, LTA).</li>
      <li>Consult a chartered accountant for complex income (rental, capital gains).</li>
    </ol>
