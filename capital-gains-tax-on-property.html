      <h2>Capital Gains Tax on Property in India</h2>
      <p>When you sell a property in India, the profit earned is taxed under the head of <strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong>. Understanding how these taxes are calculated, the applicable exemptions, and ways to save tax legally is crucial for property owners and investors.</p>

      <h3>What is Capital Gains Tax?</h3>
      <p>Capital Gains Tax is levied on the profit earned from the sale of a capital asset such as real estate, gold, shares, or bonds. In the case of property, the sale price minus the purchase price (after considering indexation and improvements) determines the taxable gain.</p>

      <h3>Types of Capital Gains on Property</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG):</strong> If you sell a property within 24 months of purchase, the gain is classified as short-term. It is taxed as per your applicable income tax slab rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</strong> If the property is held for more than 24 months, the gain is considered long-term. LTCG is taxed at 20% with indexation benefits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Calculation of Capital Gains</h3>
      <p>The calculation depends on whether the gain is short-term or long-term:</p>
      <pre>
Full Value of Consideration (Sale Price)
(-) Transfer Expenses (brokerage, stamp duty, legal fees)
(-) Indexed Cost of Acquisition
(-) Indexed Cost of Improvement
= Long-Term Capital Gain
      </pre>
      <p>For short-term gains, indexation benefits are not available, and the cost is simply subtracted from the sale price.</p>

      <h3>Indexation Benefit Explained</h3>
      <p>Indexation adjusts the purchase price of the property for inflation using the <strong>Cost Inflation Index (CII)</strong>. This reduces taxable gains, thereby lowering tax liability for long-term property sales.</p>

      <h3>Exemptions under Income Tax Act</h3>
      <p>The Income Tax Act provides several exemptions that can help reduce or eliminate capital gains tax liability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Section 54:</strong> Exemption when capital gains from sale of a residential property are reinvested into another residential property within specified timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Section 54EC:</strong> Exemption when gains are invested in notified bonds such as NHAI or REC within six months (up to ₹50 lakh).</li>
        <li><strong>Section 54F:</strong> Exemption when proceeds from sale of any long-term asset (other than residential property) are invested in a residential property.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Practical Example</h3>
      <p>Suppose you purchased a flat in 2010 for ₹40 lakh and sold it in 2024 for ₹1.2 crore. After applying indexation, the cost may rise to ₹70 lakh. Your taxable LTCG = ₹1.2 crore – ₹70 lakh = ₹50 lakh. If you invest this in another residential house, you may get full exemption under Section 54.</p>

      <h3>Tax Saving Strategies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plan the sale after 24 months to qualify for long-term benefits.</li>
        <li>Use indexation to reduce gains.</li>
        <li>Invest in eligible residential property or 54EC bonds.</li>
        <li>Time multiple property sales to optimize exemptions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Important Points to Remember</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>TDS @1% is deducted on property sale transactions above ₹50 lakh.</li>
        <li>Capital gains exemptions must be claimed before filing ITR.</li>
        <li>If exemption conditions are not met, gains become taxable in subsequent years.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Latest Updates</h3>
      <p>As per Budget 2025, there is no change in the LTCG tax rate on property. However, the exemption limits for reinvestment may be revised in future to control speculative real estate investments.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Selling property involves careful tax planning. By understanding <strong>Capital Gains Tax rules in India</strong>, making use of <strong>Sections 54, 54EC, and 54F exemptions</strong>, and planning reinvestments, you can significantly reduce your tax burden. Always consult a tax expert before finalizing property transactions to ensure compliance and maximum savings.</p>
