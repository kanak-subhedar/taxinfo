        <h1>Tax Savings Under Section 54F</h1>
        <h2><a href="https://t24k.com"> Return Home </a></h2>
        <p>Section 54F of the Income Tax Act provides an exemption on long-term capital gains (LTCG) from the sale of assets other than residential property (such as shares) if the gains are reinvested in a residential house.</p>
        
        <h2>Eligibility:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Applicable to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs).</li>
            <li>The asset sold should be a long-term capital asset other than a residential house property (e.g., shares, bonds, gold).</li>
            <li>The taxpayer must purchase or construct a residential house property within the stipulated time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conditions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purchase of Residential House:</strong> The house property must be purchased either one year before or within two years after the date of transfer of the original asset.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction of Residential House:</strong> The house property must be constructed within three years from the date of transfer of the original asset.</li>
            <li>The taxpayer should not own more than one residential house property on the date of transfer (other than the new house being purchased or constructed).</li>
            <li>The new house should not be sold within three years of its purchase or construction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Amount of Exemption:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If the cost of the new residential house is equal to or greater than the net consideration received from the transfer of the original asset, the entire capital gain is exempt.</li>
            <li>If the cost of the new residential house is less than the net consideration, the exemption is proportionate to the investment made in the new house. The formula used is:<br>
                <strong>Exemption = (Cost of New House / Net Consideration) × Capital Gain</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Calculation:</h2>
        <p>Let's say you have a long-term capital gain of ₹10,00,000 from the sale of shares and you purchase a new house worth ₹8,00,000 within the stipulated period.</p>
        <p>The exemption under Section 54F would be calculated as:</p>
        <p><strong>Exemption = (₹8,00,000 / ₹10,00,000) × ₹10,00,000 = ₹8,00,000</strong></p>
        <p>So, ₹8,00,000 of your capital gains will be exempt from tax, and you will be liable to pay tax on the remaining ₹2,00,000.</p>

        <h2>Key Points to Note:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you fail to utilize the capital gains for purchasing or constructing a house before the due date for filing the income tax return, the unutilized amount should be deposited in a Capital Gains Account Scheme (CGAS) in a nationalized bank. The amount should be utilized within the specified period to avail of the exemption.</li>
            <li>If the new house property is sold within three years of its purchase or construction, the exemption claimed will be revoked, and the capital gains will be taxed as long-term capital gains in the year of sale.</li>
        </ul>
