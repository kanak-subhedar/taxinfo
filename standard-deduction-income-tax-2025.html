    <h1>Standard Deduction in Income Tax (2025)</h1>

    <p>The standard deduction reduces taxable salary automatically. It applies to salaried individuals and pensioners — confirm the allowed amount for the year (previously ₹50,000 in many years).</p>

    <h2>Who is eligible?</h2>
    <p>Salaried employees under salary income and pensioners receiving pension from former employer’s pension schemes typically can claim the standard deduction.</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Standard deduction is subtracted directly from gross salary to arrive at taxable salary, simplifying computations (no need to submit proofs unlike many other allowances).</p>

    <footer style="margin-top:14px;color:#555">Standard deduction amounts can be revised by the government in the budget — confirm the applicable value for AY 2025–26.</footer>
