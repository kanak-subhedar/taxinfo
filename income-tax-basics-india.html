    <h1>Income Tax Basics in India — Simple Guide for Individuals (2025)</h1>

    <p class="muted">Updated: 2025. This page explains income tax slabs, how taxable income is computed, common deductions you can claim, when and how to file returns, and practical tips to reduce tax legally.</p>

    <p>Understanding income tax is essential whether you are a salaried employee, a freelancer, a professional, or a small business owner. Taxes might look complex at first, but once you know the key pieces — how income is computed, which deductions apply, and the filing process — you can confidently manage and optimize your tax position.</p>

    <h2>1. How income tax is calculated: the simple flow</h2>
    <p>At a high level, income tax computation follows these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Sum up all sources of income — salary, business/professional income, interest, capital gains, rental income, and other income.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Subtract exempt incomes (if any) and apply exemptions like House Rent Allowance (HRA) where applicable.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Claim allowable deductions under sections like <strong>80C</strong>, <strong>80D</strong>, etc. These reduce your taxable income.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Apply the applicable tax slab rates to determine tax payable.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add cess & surcharge (if applicable), subtract tax already paid (TDS, self-assessment tax) — the balance is payable or refundable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Income tax slabs (for individuals) — choose old vs new regime carefully</h2>
    <p>The Indian tax system offers two regimes: the <strong>Old Regime</strong> (with exemptions & deductions such as 80C) and the <strong>New Regime</strong> (with lower slab rates but fewer deductions). Your best choice depends on your deductions & expenses. Below is a simplified example of the new regime slab (typical for recent years) — always confirm with the latest government notification for the year you file.</p>

    <table class="table" aria-label="Tax slab example">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Income Range (₹)</th><th>Tax Rate</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Up to ₹2,50,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr>
        <tr><td>₹2,50,001 – ₹5,00,000</td><td>5%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>₹5,00,001 – ₹10,00,000</td><td>20%</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Above ₹10,00,000</td><td>30%</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="note">Note: In addition to basic slab rates, there is typically an education cess (4% on tax). Surcharge may apply above certain income thresholds. Always use the current financial year rates when calculating taxes.</p>

    <h2>3. Taxable income: included & excluded items</h2>
    <p><strong>Included:</strong> salary, allowances (taxable), bonuses, business income, interest on fixed deposits, rental income, capital gains, and other income.</p>
    <p><strong>Excluded/partially exempt:</strong> certain allowances like <em>house rent allowance (HRA)</em> (subject to calculation rules), agricultural income (in many cases), and specified tax-free allowances.</p>

    <h2>4. Most useful deductions to reduce taxable income</h2>
    <p>Common deductions (examples):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Section 80C</strong> — up to ₹1,50,000 for PPF, EPF, ELSS, life insurance, principal repayment of home loan, NSC, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Section 80D</strong> — premium paid for health insurance (self, family, parents).</li>
      <li><strong>Section 24(b)</strong> — home loan interest deduction for self-occupied or let-out property (limits apply).</li>
      <li><strong>Standard Deduction</strong> — available for salaried employees (check current fixed amount per year).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Choosing old vs new tax regime — quick checklist</h2>
    <p>If you are deciding between the two regimes, check:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do your deductions (80C + 80D + home loan interest + HRA) exceed the benefit from new-regime lower slabs? If yes → Old regime may be better.</li>
      <li>If you have little or no deductions and prefer simpler calculation → New regime may be simpler and cheaper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Filing income tax return (ITR): when & how</h2>
    <p>Key points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Deadlines:</strong> Individuals (non-audit) usually file by July 31 following the financial year (subject to extensions).</li>
      <li><strong>Documents needed:</strong> Form 16 (if salaried), bank TDS certificates, investment proofs for deductions, interest certificates, and capital gains statements.</li>
      <li><strong>Filing methods:</strong> e-file via the income tax e-filing portal, or use your CA / tax partner. For simple salaried taxpayers, filing is straightforward using ITR-1 / ITR-2 forms as applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing investment proofs for deductions claimed — keep them organized and scanned.</li>
      <li>Not reconciling Form 26AS — verify TDS credited against your PAN before filing.</li>
      <li>Using the wrong ITR form — choose the correct form for salary, business or capital gains.</li>
      <li>Delaying filing — late filing invites penalties and interest for any unpaid tax.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Practical tips to reduce tax (legally)</h2>
    <p>Some everyday strategies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Section 80C fully each year (up to ₹1,50,000) using PPF, ELSS, EPF, or NSC.</li>
      <li>Buy a health policy and claim 80D deductions for self and parents.</li>
      <li>Plan capital gains: long-term vs short-term holding periods change tax rates.</li>
      <li>For salaried people, optimize HRA and reimbursements correctly with employer.</li>
      <li>Consider tax-saving ELSS for both tax benefit and equity exposure (risk dependent).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. When to consult a tax professional</h2>
    <p>If you have rental properties, business income, foreign income, significant capital gains, or uncertain cases (e.g., disputed TDS), a chartered accountant or a qualified tax consultant can save time and often money. They help with tax planning, compliance, and representation if any notice arrives from the tax department.</p>

    <h2>10. Helpful resources & tools</h2>
    <p>To make tax management easier:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep a digital folder of proofs (scans of investment receipts, insurance, rent receipts).</li>
      <li>Use Form 26AS and the TRACES website to confirm TDS credits.</li>
      <li>Use calculators (tax calculator, HRA calculator) — we provide a set of tools on T24K for Section 80C & calculators linked in related pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">If you want, I can prepare an interactive calculator page (Section 80C, tax slab comparison, or a personalized tax planner) and we’ll add a link from this page. That helps keep visitors engaged and increases dwell time — good for SEO.</p>

    <h2>Summary — quick checklist before filing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gather Form 16 / salary slips and Form 26AS.</li>
      <li>Confirm eligible deductions (80C, 80D, HRA calculations).</li>
      <li>Decide old vs new tax regime based on estimated tax.</li>
      <li>File online before the due date; pay any self-assessment tax early.</li>
    </ul>
