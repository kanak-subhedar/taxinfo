            <li><strong>Long-Term Capital Growth:</strong> Encourages investment in equity securities, potentially offering higher returns over the long term.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
        <p>To be eligible for tax benefits under Section 80CCG:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>The investor's gross annual income should not exceed ₹12 lakh.</li>
            <li>The investment must be made in eligible securities as specified under the scheme.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important Points to Consider</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The maximum deduction allowed under Section 80CCG is 50% of the invested amount, with a maximum investment limit of ₹50,000.</li>
            <li>The lock-in period for RGESS investments is three years, with a fixed lock-in for the first year and a flexible lock-in for the subsequent two years.</li>
            <li>RGESS is aimed at first-time retail investors, and they should adhere to the scheme's conditions to avail of the benefits.</li>
        </ul>
