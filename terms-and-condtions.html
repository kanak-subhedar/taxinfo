<h3>Refund Policy for Over payment</h3>
<p>
  If you mistakenly overpay via our Razorpay payment gateway, you are eligible for a <br>
  refund of the excess amount only upon request (You may request by sending an email within 7 days 
  to refund@t24k.com with all the details including date & time of transaction).<br><br>
  However, Razorpay transaction charges (typically ~2.36% including GST for domestic payments, <br>
  and ~3.54% for international payments) will be deducted from the refund amount.<br>
  The percentage mentioned is nearby & not exact. It may change from time to time.
</p>
<p>
  Example for domestic: If you paid ₹9000 instead of ₹900, you may request a refund of ₹8100 minus gateway fees. 
  That is 9000 - 9000*2.36/100 = 8787.6 [since 9000*2.36/100 = 212.4]<br> Now deducting product cost 8787.6 - 900 = 7887.6 will be
  your refund amount.
  Refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 5-7 business days.
