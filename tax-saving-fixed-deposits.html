  <h1>Tax Saving Fixed Deposits (FDs) in India – Section 80C Benefits</h1>
  <p>Tax saving fixed deposits (FDs) are one of the most popular and safe tax-saving instruments available to Indian taxpayers. Backed by banks and financial institutions, they provide a fixed return while also helping investors claim a deduction under <strong>Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961</strong>. This makes them attractive for individuals seeking both <em>capital safety</em> and <em>tax efficiency</em>.</p>

  <h2>Key Features of Tax Saving FDs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lock-in Period:</strong> 5 years (mandatory, cannot be broken prematurely).</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Benefit:</strong> Eligible for deduction under Section 80C up to ₹1.5 lakh per financial year.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Typically ranges between 6% to 7.5% depending on the bank.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Backed by banks, low risk compared to market-linked instruments.</li>
    <li><strong>Modes:</strong> Available as single or joint holding. However, tax benefit is available only to the first holder.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
  <p>Tax saving FDs are available to <strong>resident individuals</strong> and <strong>Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs)</strong>. NRIs may not be eligible for tax deduction under Section 80C on such deposits, though some banks may allow investment.</p>

  <h2>Interest Rates on Tax Saving FDs (2025)</h2>
  <p>While rates vary from bank to bank, here’s an indicative range:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Public Sector Banks: 6.25% – 6.75%</li>
    <li>Private Banks: 6.75% – 7.50%</li>
    <li>Senior Citizens: Additional 0.50% interest benefit</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="highlight">
    Example: If you invest ₹1,00,000 in a 5-year tax-saving FD at 7% p.a., you will earn approx. ₹40,000 in interest by maturity (subject to TDS).
  </div>

  <h2>Taxation of Interest Income</h2>
  <p>Though the principal investment qualifies for Section 80C deduction, the <strong>interest earned is taxable</strong> as per the investor’s income tax slab. Banks deduct TDS if the interest exceeds ₹40,000 (₹50,000 for senior citizens) in a financial year.</p>

  <h2>How to Claim Tax Benefits?</h2>
  <p>To claim deduction under Section 80C:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the FD is specifically categorized as a “Tax Saving FD”.</li>
    <li>Submit Form 15G/15H (if applicable) to avoid unnecessary TDS deduction.</li>
    <li>Declare the FD investment while filing your Income Tax Return (ITR).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advantages of Tax Saving FDs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Safe and reliable, as they are not subject to market fluctuations.</li>
    <li>Fixed and assured returns.</li>
    <li>Simple to open and manage via banks or online platforms.</li>
    <li>Senior citizens enjoy higher interest rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limitations of Tax Saving FDs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lock-in period of 5 years – no premature withdrawal allowed.</li>
    <li>Interest income is fully taxable.</li>
    <li>Returns are lower compared to ELSS mutual funds and NPS in the long run.</li>
  </ul>
