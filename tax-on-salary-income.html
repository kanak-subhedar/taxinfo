      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Salary income forms the largest source of income for millions of individuals in India.  
        The taxation of salary is governed by the <strong>Income Tax Act, 1961</strong>.  
        A salaried employee’s tax liability depends on components like <strong>basic salary, allowances, perquisites, deductions</strong>, and chosen tax regime.  
        This guide explains everything you need to know about salary taxation in India.
      </p>

      <h2>Components of Salary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Salary:</strong> The fixed component forming the base of salary, fully taxable.</li>
        <li><strong>Dearness Allowance (DA):</strong> Paid to offset inflation, fully taxable.</li>
        <li><strong>House Rent Allowance (HRA):</strong> Partially exempt under Section 10(13A).</li>
        <li><strong>Special Allowances:</strong> Travel, education, medical, etc. Some exempt, others taxable.</li>
        <li><strong>Perquisites:</strong> Benefits like car, rent-free accommodation, stock options, taxed as per rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Standard Deduction</h2>
      <p>
        All salaried taxpayers are eligible for a <strong>Standard Deduction of ₹50,000</strong> per year (as of FY 2025-26).  
        This deduction replaced earlier medical and transport allowances.
      </p>

      <h2>House Rent Allowance (HRA) Exemption</h2>
      <p>
        HRA exemption is the lowest of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Actual HRA received</li>
        <li>50% of salary (for metro cities) or 40% (non-metros)</li>
        <li>Rent paid minus 10% of salary</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Salaried individuals staying in rented houses can claim this exemption by providing rent receipts.
      </p>

      <h2>Leave Travel Allowance (LTA)</h2>
      <p>
        Exemption is available for travel expenses (not hotel or food) within India,  
        limited to 2 journeys in a block of 4 years.
      </p>

      <h2>Perquisites and Their Taxability</h2>
      <p>
        Common taxable perquisites include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rent-free accommodation provided by employer</li>
        <li>Company-provided car for personal use</li>
        <li>Employer’s contribution to superannuation fund beyond ₹1.5 lakh</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some perquisites, like laptops or mobile phones provided for work, are tax-free.
      </p>

      <h2>Income Tax Slabs for Salaried Employees (FY 2025-26)</h2>
      <p>
        Employees can choose between the <strong>old tax regime with deductions</strong> and the <strong>new tax regime with lower rates</strong>.
      </p>
      <h3>New Tax Regime Slabs (default from FY 2025-26):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>₹0 – ₹3,00,000 → Nil</li>
        <li>₹3,00,001 – ₹7,00,000 → 5%</li>
        <li>₹7,00,001 – ₹10,00,000 → 10%</li>
        <li>₹10,00,001 – ₹12,00,000 → 15%</li>
        <li>₹12,00,001 – ₹15,00,000 → 20%</li>
        <li>Above ₹15,00,000 → 30%</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Deductions for Salaried Employees (Old Regime)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Section 80C:</strong> Investment deduction up to ₹1.5 lakh (ELSS, PPF, LIC, EPF).</li>
        <li><strong>Section 80D:</strong> Medical insurance premium deduction up to ₹25,000 (₹50,000 for senior citizens).</li>
        <li><strong>Section 24(b):</strong> Deduction up to ₹2 lakh for home loan interest.</li>
        <li><strong>80TTA/80TTB:</strong> Deduction for interest on savings account/FD.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Illustrative Example</h2>
      <p>
        Suppose a salaried employee earns ₹8,00,000 per year including HRA and allowances.  
        After claiming HRA exemption of ₹1,20,000 and standard deduction of ₹50,000, taxable income reduces to ₹6,30,000.  
        Under the new tax regime, tax will be lower if deductions under 80C/80D are not utilized.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Salary income taxation is straightforward if you understand exemptions, deductions, and allowances.  
        Opting between the old and new tax regimes should be based on your investments and expenses.  
        Proper planning ensures maximum savings and compliance with tax laws.
