    <h1>Old vs New Tax Regime 2025 — Which is Better?</h1>

    <p>Compare the traditional (old) tax regime that allows deductions (80C, HRA, etc.) vs the simplified (new) regime with lower slab rates but fewer deductions.</p>

    <h2>How to decide</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate tax payable under both regimes for your income & deductions.</li>
      <li>If total eligible deductions are high (80C, HRA, home loan), old regime might be better.</li>
      <li>If few deductions/allowances, new regime often yields lower tax.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quick example</h2>
    <p>Salary ₹8L, deductions 80C ₹1.5L + 80D ₹10k. Compare taxes under both regimes using slab tables — compute & choose the lower tax option.</p>
