    <p>Everything you need to know before buying your next bike</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Define Your Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Before you step into a showroom or browse online listings, ask yourself: <b>Why do I need a motorcycle?</b> 
      Some riders want a daily commuter for city traffic, others dream of long touring adventures, while a few are passionate about sports bikes with unmatched speed. 
      Defining your primary purpose helps narrow your choices immediately.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <b>Tip:</b> A 150cc commuter bike is practical for city rides, while a 500cc+ touring bike is better suited for highways and long trips.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Budget Planning</h2>
    <p>
      Budget is not just about the cost of the motorcycle. A smart buyer considers <b>on-road price</b>, 
      insurance, riding gear, accessories, and maintenance costs. Many first-time buyers underestimate these extras and 
      struggle later.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>On-road price = Ex-showroom + Registration + Insurance + Taxes</li>
      <li>Essential gear: Helmet, jacket, gloves, boots (₹10,000 – ₹20,000 minimum)</li>
      <li>Yearly service and maintenance (varies from ₹5,000 to ₹20,000 depending on model)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your budget is ₹1.5 lakh, consider spending ₹1.2 lakh on the bike itself and 
      reserving the rest for gear and expenses.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Engine Capacity & Performance</h2>
    <p>
      Engine capacity (cc) directly impacts performance, fuel efficiency, and handling. 
      For beginners, a 125–250cc bike is safe and efficient. For experienced riders, 
      350cc+ offers more power and long-distance comfort. Superbikes (600cc+) demand 
      skill and responsibility.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <b>Rule of Thumb:</b> Don’t buy more power than you can handle. Safety comes first.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Fuel Efficiency & Running Costs</h2>
    <p>
      In 2025, fuel prices continue to rise, making mileage a key decision factor. 
      Commuter bikes may deliver 45–60 km/l, while sports bikes may drop below 20 km/l. 
      Consider your monthly usage and calculate long-term running costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Electric motorcycles</b> are also gaining popularity, offering lower running costs, 
      but charging infrastructure may be limited in some regions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Comfort & Ergonomics</h2>
    <p>
      Sit on the motorcycle before you buy. Check whether your feet touch the ground, 
      the handlebar is at a comfortable reach, and the seat suits your height. Touring bikes 
      usually have upright seating, while sports bikes may feel aggressive for daily commuting.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Safety Features</h2>
    <p>
      Modern motorcycles are equipped with <b>ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)</b>, 
      traction control, and slipper clutches. These features save lives. 
      Always prioritize safety over fancy looks.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <b>Pro Advice:</b> Never compromise on ABS. In emergency braking, ABS can be the difference between life and death.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Resale Value</h2>
    <p>
      Not all motorcycles retain their value equally. Popular commuter brands (Hero, Honda, Yamaha) 
      often have better resale markets compared to niche premium bikes. Research the resale trend 
      before finalizing your model.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Test Ride Before You Decide</h2>
    <p>
      A bike may look perfect on paper, but your body will tell the truth in a test ride. 
      Pay attention to vibrations, comfort, gear shifting smoothness, and braking response. 
      Ride on different road conditions if possible.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. New vs. Used Motorcycles</h2>
    <p>
      A new motorcycle comes with warranty, peace of mind, and the latest features. 
      However, buying a used bike can save you 30–40% of the cost if chosen wisely. 
      Always check the service history, ownership papers, and accident records of a used motorcycle.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Final Checklist Before Buying</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Decide your purpose and budget clearly.</li>
      <li>Compare mileage, performance, and maintenance costs.</li>
      <li>Check safety features (ABS, disc brakes, lighting).</li>
      <li>Evaluate comfort and riding position.</li>
      <li>Research long-term resale value.</li>
