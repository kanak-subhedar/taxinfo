      <h2>Fixed Deposits and Taxation – An Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Fixed Deposits (FDs) are one of the most popular savings instruments in India. 
        They provide guaranteed returns and safety of capital, making them ideal for risk-averse investors. 
        However, many people overlook the fact that <strong>interest earned on FDs is fully taxable</strong> under the Income Tax Act.
      </p>

      <h2>How is FD Interest Taxed?</h2>
      <p>
        Interest earned on Fixed Deposits is added to your <strong>‘Income from Other Sources’</strong> 
        and taxed according to your income tax slab rate. 
        There is no special tax benefit unless the FD is specifically a <strong>Tax-Saving FD</strong> under Section 80C.
      </p>

      <h2>TDS Rules on Fixed Deposits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Banks deduct <strong>TDS at 10%</strong> if the total FD interest in a year exceeds ₹40,000 (₹50,000 for senior citizens).</li>
        <li>If you haven’t submitted your PAN, TDS is deducted at <strong>20%</strong>.</li>
        <li>TDS is deducted annually, even if the FD matures after several years.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Avoid Excess TDS?</h2>
      <p>
        If your total income is below the taxable limit, you can submit <strong>Form 15G</strong> (for individuals below 60) 
        or <strong>Form 15H</strong> (for senior citizens) to your bank. This ensures that TDS is not deducted.
      </p>

      <h2>Example of FD Taxation</h2>
      <p>
        Suppose you invested ₹5,00,000 in an FD at 7% annual interest. You earn ₹35,000 interest in one year.  
        Since it is below ₹40,000, no TDS is deducted.  
        However, if your total income including this interest exceeds the basic exemption limit, 
        you still need to pay tax while filing your ITR.
      </p>

      <h2>Tax-Saving Fixed Deposits</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>5-year Tax-Saving FD</strong> qualifies for deduction under Section 80C, up to ₹1.5 lakh per year.  
        However, the interest earned on such FDs is still taxable.
      </p>

      <h2>Ways to Save Tax on FD Interest</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Distribute FD investments across family members in lower tax brackets.</li>
        <li>Use senior citizen benefits like higher exemption limits.</li>
        <li>Consider alternatives like PPF, SCSS, or ELSS for tax-efficient returns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        - FD interest is fully taxable as per your slab rate. <br>
        - TDS applies if interest exceeds the threshold. <br>
        - Submit Form 15G/15H to avoid unnecessary TDS if your income is below the exemption limit. <br>
        - Tax-Saving FDs give Section 80C deduction, but interest remains taxable.  
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Fixed Deposits are safe and reliable, but investors must account for tax liability on the interest earned. 
        By planning wisely and using tax provisions effectively, you can maximize post-tax returns from your FDs.
