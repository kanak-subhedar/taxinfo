    <h2>Why Convert PDF to Excel?</h2>
    <p>
      PDFs are excellent for sharing and preserving formatting, but they are not ideal for editing or data manipulation. Excel, on the other hand, is designed for calculations, data organization, and analysis. By converting a PDF into Excel, you unlock the ability to filter, edit, calculate, and visualize data that was previously locked in a static document.
