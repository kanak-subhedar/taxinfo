      <h2>Why Merge PDF Files?</h2>
      <p>
        PDF is the most widely used format for official documents, eBooks, contracts, and presentations. However, managing multiple PDF files can often become messy. 
        Imagine having to send ten separate PDF reports when you could just <strong>merge them into one file</strong>. Our <em>free online PDF merger</em> is designed to save time, reduce clutter, and make sharing simpler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are a student combining lecture notes, a business consolidating invoices, or a researcher putting together reports, 
        merging PDFs improves efficiency and creates a professional presentation.
