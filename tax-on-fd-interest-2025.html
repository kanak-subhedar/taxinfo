    <h1>Tax on FD Interest Income in India (2025)</h1>

    <p>Interest from bank fixed deposits (FDs) is taxable as income from other sources. This page explains tax treatment, TDS thresholds, exemptions and planning tips.</p>

    <h2>TDS on FD interest</h2>
    <p>Banks and scheduled financial institutions deduct TDS at source if aggregate interest paid to an individual in a financial year exceeds the threshold (check current threshold; historically ₹40,000 and lower for senior citizens). If PAN is not furnished, TDS may be at a higher rate.</p>

    <h2>How to report FD interest</h2>
    <p>Include total interest from all FDs in ‘Income from Other Sources’ while filing ITR. If TDS was deducted, claim credit for TDS against final tax liability.</p>

    <h2>Examples & calculations</h2>
    <p>Suppose you have total FD interest ₹60,000 and your taxable income places you in 20% slab. Tax on interest = 20% of ₹60,000 = ₹12,000 plus cess. Deduct TDS already paid to compute balance payable/refundable.</p>

    <h2>Planning tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Form 15G / 15H (if eligible) to avoid TDS for small taxpayers/senior citizens if total tax liability is nil.</li>
      <li>Consider tax-saving alternatives (tax-saving FDs under Sec 80C, but these have a lock-in).</li>
      <li>Stagger maturities across years to manage TDS & tax impact.</li>
    </ul>
