    <p>Everything you need to know before buying your next bike</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Define Your Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Before you step into a showroom or browse online listings, ask yourself: <b>Why do I need a motorcycle?</b> 
      Some riders want a daily commuter for city traffic, others dream of long touring adventures, while a few are passionate about sports bikes with unmatched speed. 
      Defining your primary purpose helps narrow your choices immediately.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <b>Tip:</b> A 150cc commuter bike is practical for city rides, while a 500cc+ touring bike is better suited for highways and long trips.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Budget Planning</h2>
    <p>
      Budget is not just about the cost of the motorcycle. A smart buyer considers <b>on-road price</b>, 
      insurance, riding gear, accessories, and maintenance costs. Many first-time buyers underestimate these extras and 
      struggle later.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>On-road price = Ex-showroom + Registration + Insurance + Taxes</li>
      <li>Essential gear: Helmet, jacket, gloves, boots (₹10,000 – ₹20,000 minimum)</li>
      <li>Yearly service and maintenance (varies from ₹5,000 to ₹20,000 depending on model)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your budget is ₹1.5 lakh, consider spending ₹1.2 lakh on the bike itself and 
      reserving the rest for gear and expenses.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Engine Capacity & Performance</h2>
    <p>
      Engine capacity (cc) directly impacts performance, fuel efficiency, and handling. 
      For beginners, a 125–250cc bike is safe and efficient. For experienced riders, 
      350cc+ offers more power and long-distance comfort. Superbikes (600cc+) demand 
      skill and responsibility.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <b>Rule of Thumb:</b> Don’t buy more power than you can handle. Safety comes first.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Fuel Efficiency & Running Costs</h2>
    <p>
      In 2025, fuel prices continue to rise, making mileage a key decision factor. 
      Commuter bikes may deliver 45–60 km/l, while sports bikes may drop below 20 km/l. 
      Consider your monthly usage and calculate long-term running costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Electric motorcycles</b> are also gaining popularity, offering lower running costs, 
      but charging infrastructure may be limited in some regions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Comfort & Ergonomics</h2>
    <p>
      Sit on the motorcycle before you buy. Check whether your feet touch the ground, 
      the handlebar is at a comfortable reach, and the seat suits your height. Touring bikes 
      usually have upright seating, while sports bikes may feel aggressive for daily commuting.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Safety Features</h2>
    <p>
      Modern motorcycles are equipped with <b>ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)</b>, 
      traction control, and slipper clutches. These features save lives. 
      Always prioritize safety over fancy looks.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <b>Pro Advice:</b> Never compromise on ABS. In emergency braking, ABS can be the difference between life and death.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Resale Value</h2>
    <p>
      Not all motorcycles retain their value equally. Popular commuter brands (Hero, Honda, Yamaha) 
      often have better resale markets compared to niche premium bikes. Research the resale trend 
      before finalizing your model.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Test Ride Before You Decide</h2>
    <p>
      A bike may look perfect on paper, but your body will tell the truth in a test ride. 
      Pay attention to vibrations, comfort, gear shifting smoothness, and braking response. 
      Ride on different road conditions if possible.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. New vs. Used Motorcycles</h2>
    <p>
      A new motorcycle comes with warranty, peace of mind, and the latest features. 
      However, buying a used bike can save you 30–40% of the cost if chosen wisely. 
      Always check the service history, ownership papers, and accident records of a used motorcycle.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Final Checklist Before Buying</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Decide your purpose and budget clearly.</li>
      <li>Compare mileage, performance, and maintenance costs.</li>
      <li>Check safety features (ABS, disc brakes, lighting).</li>
      <li>Evaluate comfort and riding position.</li>
      <li>Research long-term resale value.</li>
      <li>Always test ride before final payment.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size:32px; color:#b22222; margin-bottom:20px;">Ultimate Motorcycle Buying Guide</h2>

  <p>
    Buying a motorcycle is not just a purchase; it is an experience that defines your lifestyle, commuting habits, 
    and even your weekend adventures. For first-time buyers, the choices can feel overwhelming — sports bikes, cruisers, 
    commuters, and touring machines all fight for attention. On the other hand, even experienced riders often find themselves 
    confused when comparing specifications, pricing, or the latest technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    This <strong>Motorcycle Buying Guide</strong> is designed to take away the confusion and help you make a confident decision. 
    We’ll break down the most important factors step by step: from engine size and fuel economy, to safety features, 
    comfort, and even resale value. Whether you’re buying a budget commuter for city traffic or a premium superbike for long rides, 
    the insights below will help you pick the right two-wheeler that matches your lifestyle.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin:30px 0;">

  <h3 style="color:#006400;">1. Define Your Purpose</h3>
  <p>
    The first step in buying a motorcycle is asking yourself: <em>Why am I buying this bike?</em> 
    Your purpose will influence everything from the type of engine to the design, comfort, and features. 
    Here are a few categories to think about:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
    <li><strong>Daily Commuting:</strong> If you want something for office travel or city errands, focus on fuel efficiency, light weight, and easy handling.</li>
    <li><strong>Weekend Rides:</strong> For highway trips and weekend getaways, comfort and stability matter more than mileage.</li>
    <li><strong>Adventure & Touring:</strong> Choose touring or adventure bikes with large fuel tanks, luggage options, and comfortable seats.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance & Sports:</strong> Enthusiasts who love speed should look for sports bikes with strong acceleration, ABS, and aerodynamic designs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re buying your first motorcycle, avoid going directly for the most powerful option. Start with a bike 
    you can handle confidently.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#006400;">2. Decide Your Budget</h3>
  <p>
    Motorcycles are available in a wide price range — from affordable commuter bikes to premium superbikes worth several lakhs. 
    Fixing a budget in advance prevents impulse buying and helps you compare within a defined segment.
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
    <li><strong>Entry-Level (INR 60,000 – 1,20,000):</strong> Perfect for first-time riders and city commuters.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Range (INR 1,20,000 – 3,00,000):</strong> Ideal for those who want style, some performance, and good comfort.</li>
    <li><strong>Premium (Above INR 3,00,000):</strong> Includes adventure bikes, sports machines, and tourers for experienced riders.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Don’t forget to include <strong>insurance, riding gear, and maintenance costs</strong> when planning your budget. 
    Many riders underestimate these additional expenses, only to face financial stress later.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#006400;">3. Engine Size & Performance</h3>
  <p>
    The engine is the heart of any motorcycle. A larger engine usually means more power, but it also consumes more fuel and 
    may be harder to handle for beginners. Here’s a simplified breakdown:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
    <li><strong>100cc – 150cc:</strong> Light, fuel-efficient, best for daily commuting.</li>
    <li><strong>150cc – 300cc:</strong> Balanced performance, good for city + occasional highway rides.</li>
    <li><strong>300cc – 600cc:</strong> Suitable for touring and sports, offers higher top speeds.</li>
    <li><strong>600cc & above:</strong> Superbike territory — built for thrill, long-distance rides, or racing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Tip:</strong> For new riders, a 150–250cc engine strikes the perfect balance between control and excitement.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#006400;">4. Fuel Efficiency vs. Performance</h3>
  <p>
    Some bikes give more than 60 km/l mileage, while others may offer only 15–20 km/l but deliver unmatched speed. 
    If you travel daily in heavy traffic, mileage becomes very important. But if your focus is passion, touring, or speed, 
    you might happily compromise fuel efficiency for performance.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#006400;">5. Comfort & Ergonomics</h3>
  <p>
    Comfort can make or break your riding experience. Check the seating posture — upright for commuters and tourers, 
    or aggressive leaning for sports bikes. Also look at:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
    <li><strong>Seat Height:</strong> Make sure both your feet can touch the ground when seated.</li>
    <li><strong>Suspension:</strong> Soft suspension is best for city potholes; stiffer setups suit highways.</li>
    <li><strong>Handlebar Position:</strong> High handlebars are more relaxed; low clip-ons are sporty but tiring for long rides.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#006400;">6. Safety Features</h3>
  <p>
    A safe motorcycle is as important as a fast one. Look for features like:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
    <li>ABS (Anti-lock Braking System)</li>
    <li>Disc Brakes (Front and Rear)</li>
    <li>Traction Control (in premium bikes)</li>
    <li>LED Headlamps for visibility</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Remember, a helmet and proper riding gear are non-negotiable investments for your safety.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#006400;">7. Resale Value</h3>
  <p>
    If you plan to upgrade later, consider brands and models that hold value well in the second-hand market. 
    Japanese bikes (like Honda, Yamaha) often have higher resale value compared to niche or luxury brands.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin:30px 0;">

  <h3 style="color:#8b0000;">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
  <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
    <li>Buying only based on looks without testing comfort.</li>
    <li>Ignoring insurance and running costs.</li>
    <li>Overestimating riding skills and buying too powerful a bike.</li>
    <li>Skipping test rides before finalizing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:#8b0000;">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The best motorcycle is the one that fits <strong>your lifestyle, budget, and comfort</strong>. 
    Instead of chasing trends, focus on practicality, safety, and how the bike makes you feel when you ride it. 
    A thoughtful decision now will save you money, enhance your safety, and give you years of joyful riding.
