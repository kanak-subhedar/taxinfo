        <h2>Example Calculation:</h2>
        <p>Let's consider an example of an individual who invests in various instruments under Section 80C:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PPF Contribution: ₹50,000</li>
            <li>ELSS Investment: ₹30,000</li>
            <li>Life Insurance Premium: ₹20,000</li>
            <li>Home Loan Principal Repayment: ₹40,000</li>
            <li>Tuition Fees: ₹10,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Total Investment: ₹50,000 + ₹30,000 + ₹20,000 + ₹40,000 + ₹10,000 = ₹1,50,000</p>
        <p>The total eligible deduction under Section 80C for this individual is ₹1,50,000, which is the maximum limit.</p>
