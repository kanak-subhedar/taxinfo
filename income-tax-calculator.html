        <p>Income tax filing is essential for every citizen. The government uses the collected tax revenue for development projects, infrastructure, defense, and public welfare. Filing your income tax on time avoids penalties, legal issues, and ensures you're compliant with tax laws.</p>
        
        <p>Some of the essential things to keep in mind while calculating income tax include understanding your income sources, identifying eligible deductions, and calculating the correct tax slab under which you fall. Tax deductions are a powerful way to reduce your taxable income. These may include medical insurance premiums, home loan interest, donations to charity, and education expenses.</p>
