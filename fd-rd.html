    <h1>Understanding Fixed Deposit (FD) and Recurring Deposit (RD)</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://t24k.com"> Return Home </a></h2>
    <h2>What is a Fixed Deposit (FD)?</h2>
    <p>A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a financial instrument provided by banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) where you can invest a lump sum amount of money for a fixed period at a predetermined interest rate. Once you make the deposit, it earns interest throughout the tenure and is returned at the end of the maturity period along with the interest earned.</p>

    <h2>What is a Recurring Deposit (RD)?</h2>
    <p>A Recurring Deposit (RD) is a savings plan where you deposit a fixed amount of money every month for a specified tenure, and it earns interest. This is ideal for people who want to save regularly. At the end of the RD tenure, you receive the sum of all your monthly deposits along with the interest earned.</p>

    <h2>Example: How FD and RD Work</h2>
    <h3>FD Example:</h3>
    <p>If you invest ₹1,00,000 in a Fixed Deposit at 6% interest for 1 year, the maturity amount would be:</p>
    <p><strong>Maturity Amount = ₹1,00,000 + (₹1,00,000 * 6%) = ₹1,06,000</strong></p>
    <p>Note: Interest will be compounding at every 3 months. Just to be simple, we did not considered compounding</p>
    <h3>RD Example:</h3>
    <p>If you deposit ₹5,000 every month in a Recurring Deposit at 6% interest for 1 year, the maturity amount would be:</p>
    <p><strong>Maturity Amount = ₹60,000 (total deposits) + Interest Earned = ₹61,856</strong></p>

    <h2>Penalty for Early Withdrawal</h2>
    <p>Both FD and RD come with penalties if withdrawn before the maturity period:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FD Penalty:</strong> Banks usually reduce the interest rate by 0.5% to 1% for premature withdrawals.</li>
        <li><strong>RD Penalty:</strong> Penalty charges vary from bank to bank. Some banks may offer reduced interest, while others may charge a fee for premature withdrawal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Happens on Maturity?</h2>
    <p>At the time of maturity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FD:</strong> The total principal amount and interest accrued over the investment period are credited to your account.</li>
        <li><strong>RD:</strong> The total amount deposited monthly along with the accumulated interest is paid out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Both Fixed Deposits (FD) and Recurring Deposits (RD) are reliable and safe savings options, especially for risk-averse investors. FDs are better for those who have a lump sum amount to invest, while RDs suit individuals who prefer to save systematically on a monthly basis. It's essential to consider the interest rates, penalties, and tenure before making a decision.</p>
