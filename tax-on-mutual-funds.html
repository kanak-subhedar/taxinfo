      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Mutual funds are one of the most popular investment options in India, 
        offering diversification, professional management, and the potential for wealth creation.  
        However, investors must also be aware of the <strong>tax implications on mutual fund returns</strong>.  
        The taxation depends on the type of fund and the holding period.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Mutual Funds and Their Taxation</h2>
      <h3>1. Equity Mutual Funds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG):</strong> If units are sold within 12 months, the gain is taxed at 15%.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG):</strong> If held for more than 12 months, gains above ₹1 lakh are taxed at 10% (without indexation).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Debt Mutual Funds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>STCG:</strong> If sold before 36 months, the gains are taxed as per your income tax slab.</li>
        <li><strong>LTCG:</strong> If held for more than 36 months, gains are taxed at 20% with indexation benefits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Hybrid Mutual Funds</h3>
      <p>
        Tax treatment depends on the equity component:  
        - If equity exposure is ≥65%, it is taxed like equity funds.  
        - If equity exposure is <65%, it is taxed like debt funds.
      </p>

      <h2>Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) Replaced by TDS</h2>
      <p>
        Earlier, dividends were tax-free for investors, but now <strong>dividends are taxable in the hands of investors</strong>.  
        Mutual fund houses deduct <strong>TDS at 10%</strong> if dividend payout exceeds ₹5,000 in a year.
      </p>

      <h2>Indexation Benefit in Debt Funds</h2>
      <p>
        Indexation allows investors to adjust the purchase price for inflation, reducing taxable gains.  
        For example, if you invested ₹1,00,000 in a debt fund in 2019 and sold it in 2024 for ₹1,50,000,  
        after applying indexation, the taxable gain may reduce significantly.
      </p>

      <h2>Tax-Saving Mutual Funds (ELSS)</h2>
      <p>
        Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) mutual funds are eligible for deduction under <strong>Section 80C</strong> up to ₹1.5 lakh.  
        These funds have a lock-in period of 3 years and are a popular tax-saving option.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Save Tax on Mutual Funds?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>ELSS funds</strong> to claim 80C deductions.</li>
        <li>Plan redemptions to use the ₹1 lakh LTCG exemption each year.</li>
        <li>Split withdrawals over financial years to optimize tax.</li>
        <li>Choose growth option over dividend for better tax efficiency (depending on needs).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Example of Tax Calculation</h2>
      <p>
        Suppose you invested ₹2,00,000 in an equity fund and sold it after 2 years for ₹2,80,000.  
        The gain is ₹80,000, which is within the ₹1 lakh LTCG exemption – so <strong>no tax is payable</strong>.  
        If the gain was ₹1,50,000, then tax would apply only on ₹50,000 at 10%.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Taxation of mutual funds is straightforward if you understand the type of fund and holding period.  
        Equity funds benefit from lower tax rates and exemptions, while debt funds benefit from indexation on long-term gains.  
        Strategic planning can significantly reduce tax liability and maximize your returns.
