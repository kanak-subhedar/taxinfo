    <h1>How to Save the 1% TCS Paid During Vehicle Purchase</h1>

    <p>When purchasing a motor vehicle valued above ₹10 lakhs, the seller is required to collect 1% of the sale consideration as Tax Collected at Source (TCS). This TCS amount is then deposited with the Income Tax Department and is reflected in your <a href=script_for_tax_statement_1>Form 26AS.</a></p>

    <h2>Understanding TCS</h2>
    <p>Tax Collected at Source (TCS) is a tax payable by the seller, but the burden is passed on to the buyer. For vehicles, the TCS is applicable when the purchase price exceeds ₹10 lakhs. The TCS collected can be claimed as a tax credit by the buyer at the time of filing their income tax return (ITR).</p>

    <h2>Steps to Claim TCS Credit in Your ITR</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure that the TCS amount paid is reflected in your <a href=script_for_tax_statement_1>Form 26AS.</a> This document is accessible through the Income Tax Department's e-filing portal.</li>
        <li>While filing your Income Tax Return (ITR), navigate to the section for 'TDS and TCS'.</li>
        <li>Enter the details of the TCS amount paid during the vehicle purchase. This will usually be auto-populated from your <a href=script_for_tax_statement_1>Form 26AS.</a></li>
        <li>The TCS amount will be added to your total tax paid, reducing your tax liability or increasing your tax refund, depending on your overall tax situation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
    <p>For instance, if you purchased a car for ₹15 lakhs, the dealer would have collected ₹15,000 (1% of ₹15 lakhs) as TCS. This ₹15,000 can be claimed as a tax credit when filing your ITR. If your total tax liability was ₹1 lakh, this TCS amount will be deducted, leaving you with a net payable tax of ₹85,000.</p>

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure that the TCS amount is correctly reflected in your <a href=script_for_tax_statement_1>Form 26AS.</a> If there is any discrepancy, contact the seller or the Income Tax Department for rectification.</li>
        <li>TCS can only be claimed as a credit if it is included in your <a href=script_for_tax_statement_1>Form 26AS.</a> If it is not reflected, you will not be able to claim it in your ITR.</li>
        <li>Keep all the purchase documents, such as the invoice and the TCS certificate, safe as they may be required for verification purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that the 1% TCS paid during your vehicle purchase is properly credited against your tax liability, helping you save on taxes and avoid overpayment.</p>
